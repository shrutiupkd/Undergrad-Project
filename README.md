Recommending Project Resources using Content-based Filtering

ABSTRACT : The advent of the internet has offered its users with various options as a means of its
resources. However, it does it efficiently cater to the preferences of the users correctly. This is
especially true in the case of project building where resources are scattered and varying in its
location and type. This report explores a project about a web-based project that aims to
resolve the users query using machine learning technique of content-based filtering. A
complete analysis of this model is presented in this study ranging from its efficiency with
respect to existing models, its business relevance and similarly more. A comprehensive study
of techniques and algorithms that have been used to build this recommendation system
specifically The count vectorization method will be discussed in detail. To design and
implement a content-based recommender system for answering web based user query. The
project aims to resolve user queries using machine learning techniques of content based
filtering. Count Vectorization Method is used to find the recommendation options and we will
be web scraping method to provide the user with links.
The idea of this project is to give insights about a web-based project that aims to resolve the
users query using machine learning technique of content-based filtering. The crux is to define
the scope of the website. It becomes crucial to understand the business prospects of the
project along with the relevance in the current technical world.
This project includes 1000+ amounts of data scraped from the web. It is able to recommend
the projects to the user based on its queries and able to provide with the resources they need.
